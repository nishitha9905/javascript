fetched the event handler to the button attribute using javascript 
i have assigned several colors to a variable called color in the array format
and took a default color as first color by assigning the index value =0
and assigning all the color in a sequential manner by incrementing the index value each time
once the index value is equal to color.length then index value will be reassigned to 0
