Task given is  - To design a webpage which can change the styles in a dynamic way by user
i have designed 5 dropdowns in html named 
color , backgroundcolor,fontsize,fontweight,padding
each contains its property values 
and based on the value selected in the dropdown the style of the page will be changed
this i have done with the javascript (DOM manipulation)
by using a keywords like getElementById ,getElementsByTagName etc..,
initially all the elements have been declared with the unique id names
so using those id names i have changed the styles dynamically based on the selection
when user selects particular value ,it will be sent to the function using this keyword and will be manipulating accordingly
when we want to manipulate multiple elements at a time i have used a keyword called getElementsByTagName and done similar process as like id
