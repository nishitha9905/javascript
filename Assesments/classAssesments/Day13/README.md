Task given is to move the box on every mouse hover
-ui has been designed , A box with the text as catchMe!
once user hovers on the box it keeps on moving to some other position
this has been done with dom manipulation
width and height has been captured with the help of window.innerWidth & window.innerHeight
in the eventlistner "mouseover" , with the help of built in function in javascript
getBoundingClientRect() - which return 8 properties of the Dom object (left, top, right, bottom, x, y, width, height.)
and called a function which helps me to update box position value every time
based on the position of the box returned every time left and top values of the box where updated
