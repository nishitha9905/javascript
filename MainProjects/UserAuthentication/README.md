Task given is to build an login/register page by fetching api details accordingly
-Intially i have designed login and register page with the required input fields in each of them so that it should fetch all the details accordingly
login/register pages were built in same page in the side by side using the ui style display flex
and then forgot password url has been fetched in login page so that when the user clicks on forgot password link he will be redirected to forgot password page 
In forgot password page there is an email input field to get mail details from the user 
once the user gives email and clicks on reset password he will be redirected to otp sent message and a link for reset password page
on clicking A button named with reset password user redirects to reset password page and will give the details which are required
otp will be sent to the user mail id and once user fill the details and click on reset password button password will be changed successfully 

for this entire process the technology i have used from javascript is
Fetch api details - using fetch method i have fetched api url and with the status code i have got from the api shown success/error message to the user

Dom Manipulation - made error/success message displayed when required for the user

form handling has been done with the required input elements in all the pages

window.navigation() - when the user wants to navigate from one to other page navigate() method has been used

window.localstorage - has been used as temporary database to store the details provided by the user
